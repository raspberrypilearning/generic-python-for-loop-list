This **for loop** which will print each item in the `animals` list.

```python
animals = ["fox", "wolf", "panda", "squirrel"]

for animal in animals:
  print(animal)
```

The output is:

    fox
    wolf
    panda
    squirrel
    

Notice that the `print` line of code is slightly further to the right. This is called **indentation** - the line is **indented** to show that it is inside the loop. Any lines of code inside the loop will be repeated.
